## Installation
   Make an empty github repository without a README.md  or license selection. Clone down the repository. Next you will need to use npm init and add a .gitignore file. add node_modules/ and DS_Store/  so files will be untracked. Next install iquirer and badge-maker using npm i ... . Create prompts to use in the command line  and use writeFile to create a README.md file by importing inquirer , fs and  generateMarkdown from generateMarkdown.js. In generateMarkdown.js create a license badge function, license link function and a license section function. Along with a complete emcompassing function called generateMarkdown that is exported to index.js. Answer prompts in terminal , observe changes and save and commit changes to github.

## Contributing
    Github, terminal, npm install iquirer and badge-maker, index.js, generateMarkdown.js, JavaScript, Node.JS, package. JSON, and the created README.md file are all necessary and important tools to be able to recreate this project. 

## Tests
    Once you get the prompts to be fully functional console.log('')  as much as possible, seeing if your input changes in the created README.md file, as well as using 'git add -A' and 'git commit -m ''' as much as possible to save your changes to github. This also benefits in seeing if the badges have properly rendered and improving the general layout of the page itself.
